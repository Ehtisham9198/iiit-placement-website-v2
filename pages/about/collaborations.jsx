                  &nbsp;Industry collaborations have been the centre of focus
                  for any successful IT based institute. We believe in
                  collaborations that genuinely help our students to get
                  acquainted with modern industry trends. IIIT Bhubaneswar is
                  proud to tie up with two global giants,IBM and Capgemini. IBM
                  initiated a university program with our institute to conduct
                  various real life projects as well as training sessions. They
                  will also conduct many workshops and demonstrations in our
                  institute with this collaboration. With this program our
                  students would get an opportunity to know about the various
                  procedures involved in making real life software.&nbsp;
